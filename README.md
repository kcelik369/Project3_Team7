# UC Berkeley Extension Data Analysis Project 3 - Team 7
We are investigating a dataset for Seattle Airbnb data found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
Original source of the data is here (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), which provides access to more recent data and for other cities.

We hope to create a set of tables that could be used to answer the following questions:
- What factors are most strongly linked with good ratings / high prices / frequent bookings?
- What outliers exist for the above major factors?
- What is the correlation between these major factors and do they have any significant correlation with other minor factors?
- Can we observe any fluctuations in price (extra credit: other characteristics) based on month / season?
- If you want to start hosting in Seattle (or generally), what factors correlate with success or positive host ratings?
- Are hosts with many Airbnb listings significantly different from hosts with fewer listings?

1. Our questions are limited to the ~2016 dataset;
2. Given access to more cities' data, what might change or not?
2. Given access to more recent Seattl data, what might change or not?

Data ethics: maybe provide a boolean flag for devs to keep this data?
1. Names
1. Streets
1. VERY specific lat, long
1. Dataset source: Kaggle
2. Reliability?
2. Accurate picture of AirBnb data? Already transformed?

Other Seattle datasets to add additional info / minor factors to evaluate on?
- Neighborhood Scout (?)
- Redfin (?): walk score, transit score, etc.
- Zillow (?)
